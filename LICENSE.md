# pulaCreative portfolio licenses

As this site is a creative portfolio of my own work, I need to post two separate license.

The standard **MIT License** covers the open source use of any code associated with the site. I am a big fan of open source coding and web development, and frankly I wish more academics in the humanities (my professional field) shared knowledge as freely as open source coders.

I'm sure there is an essay there.

Since I write a lot - teaching materials, essays, blog posts, scholarly articles, etc. - and I often compose and record music I like to share with people, I am choosing to use a **Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License**. Unless I make a mistake or two, you should assume that any creative work and/or intellectual property that is not clearly cited belongs to me, and falls under my general copyright notice for creative/intellectual property:
